# Practical-Crypto
This will contain the class projects I take up during the Practical Cryptographic Systems taught by Dr Matt Green at Johns Hopkins University


1. aes_cbc_enc_hmac_sha1.py: In this project we were required to implement a python based encrytion/decryption system. If you look at the code, there are some obvious security holes (using SHA1, mac then encrypt with padding not included in MAC). These were a part of the guidelines of implementation that was expected from us. The aim of this exercise was to give us first hand experience of how to implement an encryption/decryption scheme, what goes on inside HMAC and what and where the loopholes in the mechanism are.
